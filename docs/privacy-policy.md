### The future

With enough community support, we plan to host the iCal files on an Amazon S3 bucket and provide the user with a button to choose to receive an iCal file URL to import to your calendar. This ensures your local calendar is always up-to-date with the AWS Events app every 8/16/24 hours when the calendar pulls updates from the S3 bucket URL. No customer personally identifiable information (PII) would be needed for this functionality and any PII indicators will be dropped from the content stored including names, contact information (if any). 

We could also support other events based on community contributions.

**Thank you for using the AWS re:Invent iCal Chrome extension. I fully hope to see you every re:Invent.**
